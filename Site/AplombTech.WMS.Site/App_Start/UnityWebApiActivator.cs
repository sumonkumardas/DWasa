// This file is deliberately empty.  The file is installed by the Unity.AspNet.WebApi package,
// the .dll of which is needed to run NakedObjects.Mvc.  The NakedObjects.Mvc-FileTemplates package then
// over-writes the file with this comment, because this specific file is not needed to run 
// NakedObjects.Mvc and could otherwise be a source of confusion. Deleting the whole file would
// create the risk of it being re-installed at a future point.
