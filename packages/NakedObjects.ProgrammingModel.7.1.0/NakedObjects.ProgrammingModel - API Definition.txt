This document defines the API for the NakedObjects.ProgrammingModel package


The API for this package comprises the signature of every class and interface defined in it  -  since they are all intended to be used by the application programmer.

Note that this includes both the interfaces defined in the NakedObjects.Api.dll, and the interfaces and classes defined in NakedObjects.Helpers.Api

Dependencies:  NakedObjects.Ide.  However, since that package does not have an API, version changes on the Ide will not impact the ProgrammingModel

Current version:  5.0

Changes from previous version:

- Deletion of previously obsoleted attributes, and methods on helper classes
